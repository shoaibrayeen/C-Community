# Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous.

# Constraints
-  Sequences Should be Non-Null

# Input
- Two String Sequences

# Output
- Length of Longest Common Subsequence

```
sequence1     :   ABCDGH
sequence2     :   AEDFHR
Output        :   3 -> {ADH is common in both sequences}



sequence1     :   AGGTAB
sequence2     :   GXTXAYB
Output        :   4 -> {GTAB is common in both sequences}


```
