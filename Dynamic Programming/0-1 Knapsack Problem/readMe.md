# Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it

# Constraints
-  1 < W <= 10^6
-  0 < weights,value <= 10^9

# Input
- Max Capacity
- Weights
- Values

# Output
- Maximum Value Can be generated by W

```
Max Capacity  :   50
Weights       :  [ 10, 20, 30 ]
Values        :  [ 60, 100, 120 ]
Output        : 220

```
