## MULTIPLAYER FRUIT NINJA KINDA GAME
Fruit Ninja has always been a great game which requires focus and ofcourse it's rewarding also. This idea includes the concept of both Fruit Ninja & Ludo.

- It'll be a multiplayer game and each player will select a different color for themselves from 4 given colors.
- Moving further each player will play a game similar to fruit ninja but the condition will be "They cannot cut the fruit or say the item of the color that they chose for themelves".
- As the time progresses the speed of items or say fruits dropping will increase.
- Each player will be allowed to do 5 mistakes (cutting the item of the color that they chose) at max and for each wrong move the speed of the items dropping will be reducedand. 
- Each item rightly cut will increase the score by 1.
- At last the one with the highest score will win and thus we can maintain a leaderboard for them too.

- We can also add timers and other functionalities to make this game more interesting.
