        e.g. - 5 = 101 in binary representation
               1 = 001 in binary representation
    their (and)& = 001 in binary and equal to 1 in decimal system
        hence if & of a number with 1 gives you 1, then the number is odd.
       
        e.g.2 - 4 = 100   in binary representation
                1 = 001   in binary representation
     their (and)& = 000   in binary and equal to 0 in decimal       
        hence if & of a number with 1 gives you 0, then the number is even.
