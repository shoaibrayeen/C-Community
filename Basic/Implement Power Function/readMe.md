# Base and its power are given. You need to implement power function without using power operation.

## Constraints
- Base and power could be negative as well as positive.

## Input
- Base
- Power

## Output
- Return Answer after Base^Power

```
  Base = 2, Power = 4
  Output = 16
  
  Base = -2, Power = 4
  Output = 16
  
  Base = 2, Power = -2
  Output = 0.25
  
  Base = -2, Power = -2
  Output = 0.25
```
