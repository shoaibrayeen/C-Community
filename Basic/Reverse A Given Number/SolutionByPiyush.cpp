Program Description: A Number is given and You need to reverse it.
Output: Reverse of the number
Solution Description: I will traverse the number from the last digit and will go to the very first digit and will keep on storing each digit in a varibale and then deleting that digit from the number and then that new variable will result to be the reverse of the given number.
